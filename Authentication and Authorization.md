Token-based and session-based authentication are two common approaches used to manage user authentication and authorization in web applications.

# Token-Based Authentication
> Token-based authentication is stateless, meaning the server does not store any information about the authenticated user. The token itself contains all the necessary information, making it suitable for distributed and scalable architectures.  

> In token-based authentication, the server generates a unique token (also known as a bearer token or access token) upon successful user authentication.  
> The token contains encrypted information about the user's identity and any associated permissions or roles.  
> After the token is generated, the server sends it to the client (usually in the response headers or as a cookie).  
> The client (typically a web browser or mobile app) stores the token locally, usually in memory or in a client-side storage mechanism like localStorage or sessionStorage.  
> For subsequent requests to the server, the client includes the token in the request headers (e.g., in the "Authorization" header) to authenticate itself.  
> The server verifies the token's validity and extracts the user's identity and permissions from the token to grant access to the requested resources.  

# Session-Based Authentication
> Session-based authentication requires the server to maintain state information about each active session, which can be a challenge in distributed or load-balanced environments. To handle state across multiple servers, session data is often stored in a shared database or cache.

> In session-based authentication, the server creates a unique session for each authenticated user upon successful login.  
> The server stores session data on the server-side, typically in memory, a database, or a cache store.  
> After successful authentication, the server sends a session identifier (session ID) to the client, usually in the form of a session cookie.  
> The client sends the session ID back to the server with each subsequent request to maintain the session state.  
> The server uses the session ID to look up the associated session data to authenticate the user and authorize access to resources.

# Authentication
> Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or application. It ensures that the claimed identity (e.g., username, email, or token) is valid and corresponds to an authenticated entity.
>
> In both token-based and session-based approaches, authentication is involved.  
> Upon successful authentication/login, the server issues a token (in token-based authentication) or creates a session (in session-based authentication) to remember the authenticated user.  

<br/>

# Authorization
> Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources an authenticated user or application is allowed to access.  

> It involves checking the permissions, roles, or privileges associated with the authenticated entity to ensure they have the necessary rights to perform certain actions or view specific data.   

> In token-based and session-based approaches, authorization comes into play after authentication. Once a user is authenticated and their identity is established, the server looks up the user's permissions or roles (often stored in a database) to determine what they are authorized to do. This step ensures that the user has the appropriate access rights to interact with the requested resources or perform certain actions.

> In summary, authentication verifies the identity of a user or application, while authorization determines what actions or resources that authenticated entity is allowed to access. Both processes are essential components of a secure authentication and access control system in web applications.
